# Welcome to the Biofuse Repo

I've compiled a version history from [![1.2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.2.0-purple)](https://github.com/MeshyDev/BioFuse_Repo/commit/0c287aa0aa7d741304aed0a55f97146b0272a5db) => current.

There is a branch for [![1.10.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.10.0-orange)](https://github.com/MeshyDev/BioFuse_Repo/tree/1.10.0), it's being developed alongside another project *relating* to Biofuse.
Seriously, it's gonna be pretty cool.

### 🚀 New Features
- Bundled with a Windows 11 launcher to fix some finicky OS behavior.
- Added flavor text for each president upon death by presidential beatdown.
- Added CDM flavor text for certain "boss" enemies (those with music).
- Added a special-case weapon available for purchase after Level 100.
- You can now imbue your weapons with up to 4 modifiers in the shop.
- Gave the Shopkeep some actual character. He’s got opinions now.

### 🛠 Gameplay Changes & Improvements
- Changed text under the music toggle to acknowledge the Windows 11 launcher.
- Changed how enemy statuses affect their numbers: Sick damage now scales off the enemy’s max HP.
- Moved XP debug into the debug menu.
- Text added to multiple (Presidential) encounters when fleeing.
- You cannot flee from The President. Don’t even try.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed typos (including “Forrest” → “Forest”).
- Fixed a bug where the jukebox was preventing CDM lines from appearing.
- Fixed a bug where fleeing from an enemy with massive damage output (e.g., 50,000 flat) could heal you.
- Fixed a bug where blocking such enemies could also heal you—now it breaks through defense and deals 10,000 damage.
- Fixed a bug where the Bot Buster wouldn’t display its flavor text.
- Fixed a Missing Operator bug affecting Infection damage.

### ✨ Known Bug That Became a Feature
- If you’re as roided out as Uncle and kill two boss-type enemies (with music), the CDM script gets cranky and refuses to display. It’s not broken—it’s just bitchy.
