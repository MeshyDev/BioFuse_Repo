## ![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-red) I'm trying to eventually complete these <3
- Add 3 new weapons, 2 less than god finger to fill the gap and 1 more than god finger for funsies
- Revamp math on status effects
- Add one more status effect modifier for mobs, this means that instead of a mob ceasing to be sick when 
engulfed in flames, it'll be burning AND sick. I think I might make the enemies heal spell cure sickness *shrug*
- Perhaps a complete rebalancing is in order
- Add 5 new enemies per level 
- Restrict certain locations to certain levels
