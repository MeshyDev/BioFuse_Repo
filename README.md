# Welcome to the Biofuse Repo

I've compiled a version history from 1.2.0 => current.

This is the branch for 1.10.0, it's being developed alongside another project *relating* to Biofuse.
Seriously, it's gonna be pretty cool.

******

Current changes so far:
**1.10.0**

`- Added a level scaling system that triggers at Level 30. Starts at 2 @ lvl 30. It increments by 1 every 3 levels after 30. 
- Added a line to Character Stats page that shows "Enemy Aggravation Level".
- Added a cutscene at Level 30 involving the Shopkeep
- Added logic to trigger cutscene for people level 30+
- Changed how Corruption works on enemies (instead of self destructing, it only gets minorly hurt)
- Fixed a bug where God Finger wouldn't show up as equipped
- Tweaked text for imbuing finger energy
- Fixed a case where CDM wasn't processing correctly. 
- Added 283 new lines of Custom Death Messages. 
- Added 3 new tiers of CDM's based on how much killing you've done :) 
- Added ability to test CDM tiers in Debug Room`
