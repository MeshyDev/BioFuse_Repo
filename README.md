# Welcome to the Biofuse Repo

I've compiled a version history from 1.2.0 => current.

This is the branch for 1.10.0, it's being developed alongside another project *relating* to Biofuse.
Seriously, it's gonna be pretty cool.

******

Current changes so far:
**1.10.0**

1.10.0

- Added a level scaling system that triggers at Level 30. Starts at 2 @ lvl 30. It increments by 1 every 3 levels after 30. 
- Added a line to Character Stats page that shows "Enemy Aggravation Level".
- Added a cutscene at Level 30 involving the Shopkeep
- Added logic to trigger cutscene for people level 30+
- Changed how Corruption works on enemies (instead of self destructing, it only gets minorly hurt)
- Fixed a bug where God Finger wouldn't show up as equipped
- Tweaked text for imbuing finger energy
- Fixed a case where CDM wasn't processing correctly. 
- Added 283 new lines of Custom Death Messages. 
- Added 3 new tiers of CDM's based on how much killing you've done :) 
- Added ability to test CDM tiers in Debug Room
- Changed how the Finger's effect works, later levels will love it
- Imbuing weapons has been locked to level 30+
- Presidents Office now shows up at level 30, however I don't think you'll survive it
- Fixed a bug where swinging your fists wouldn't show up as expected
- Changed the text on the fists after 10+ years I'm pretty sure
- Added flavor text for when enemy is either at 0 HP and attacks, or below 0 HP

## TODO! I'm trying to eventually complete these <3
[ ] Add 3 new weapons, 2 less than god finger to fill the gap and 1 more than god finger for funsies
[ ] Revamp math on status effects
[ ] Add one more status effect modifier for mobs, this means that instead of a mob ceasing to be sick when 
engulfed in flames, it'll be burning AND sick. I think I might make the enemies heal spell cure sickness *shrug*
[ ] Perhaps a complete rebalancing is in order
[ ] Add 5 new enemies per level 
[ ] Restrict certain locations to certain levels
