1.4.0
As of 1.4.0, Biofuse should now be only seen as a text engine of my own creation. I'll keep
improving it over here, but you might find some later games of mine utilizing this. 

- Fixed a bug where being drained on EP will display an odd error message
- Went on a wild missing operand hunt, if you find it lemme know. It owes me money. 
- Found a goof in the save chunk, wouldn't load an entire line right
- An entire weapon system added with 4 new EQUIPPABLE weapons.
- Weapon modifiers, like flame or sickness to be added later. 
- Tweaked the nodes gained rate.
- My SETLOCAL endeavors will be thwarted no longer! 
^ EVERY VERSION of BioFuse had this bug! I'm actually really happy I figured it out
- HP potions now only restore 25 HP, run for 150 at the store and you can have as many as you want. 
- EP potions now only restore 35 EP compared to total refill and run for 200 at the store. Almost the same as HP potions. 
- After nearly 6 years of contemplation, searching for loot was cut. 
- My SETLOCAL endeavors were thwarted by exclamation points. 

1.5.0

- Fixed a bug where robots wouldn't take corruption damage properly
- Added the "infected" health tag, only applies to robots.
- Added a new weapon, "Death Machine"
- Removed delayed expansion on checkVar as it was causing issues.
- Fixed EXP and Nodes not properly adding to the user's stats.
- Fixed an issue where checkVar would send you back into battle with an enemy in the negative HP... living dead thing.
- I cannot guarantee that the save will "fix" itself due to the way batch saves things. 
- Added in a few details relating to the negative HP thing. If an enemies HP EQUALS 0, they get one final shot- and a bonus to the user!
^ Because it's not a bug, it's a feature muahaha
- Fixed Flatlands having 1, 2, 4 as the options.
- Fixed Forest having improperly set command variables
- Fixed BioFuse in general being formatted as LF instead of CRLF because Windows is speshul.
- The missing operands came back for me, generally speaking it won't really affect gameplay since it only happens on the first fight or damage or whatever.
It's super inconsistent and I'm just gonna leave it be unless I feel like trying to make delayedexpansion work again. But it broke other things in a major way
so like... no. Deal with the missing operands for a turn. 
- Maybe I'll remove all the little ^'s littered about all the dialogue. Maybe. It'll prolly be something like update 1.5.1 if I ever wanna do some janitor work.
