My reasoning for removing the 'bought' variable was because it was redundant. 
If the user has x amount of that item, allow equip. 
Note: Stripping these variables do sort of make previous versions defunct. If your previous save 
worked on 0.2.7 it might work on 1.2.0 but it may mix other variables due to the way Batch handles 
pulling up saves. Further testing will tell me.
