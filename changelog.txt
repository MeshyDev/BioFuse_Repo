1.4.0
As of 1.4.0, Biofuse should now be only seen as a text engine of my own creation. I'll keep
improving it over here, but you might find some later games of mine utilizing this. 

- Fixed a bug where being drained on EP will display an odd error message
- Went on a wild missing operand hunt, if you find it lemme know. It owes me money. 
- Found a goof in the save chunk, wouldn't load an entire line right
- An entire weapon system added with 4 new EQUIPPABLE weapons.
- Weapon modifiers, like flame or sickness to be added later. 
- Tweaked the nodes gained rate.
- My SETLOCAL endeavors will be thwarted no longer! 
^ EVERY VERSION of BioFuse had this bug! I'm actually really happy I figured it out
- HP potions now only restore 25 HP, run for 150 at the store and you can have as many as you want. 
- EP potions now only restore 35 EP compared to total refill and run for 200 at the store. Almost the same as HP potions. 
- After nearly 6 years of contemplation, searching for loot was cut. 
- My SETLOCAL endeavors were thwarted by exclamation points.
